Hi, I am **Frithjof Gressmann**. I am a Ph.D. student in the department of Computer Science at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC).

I work in the [ParasolLab](https://parasollab.web.illinois.edu/) on the [Mind In Vitro project](https://mindinvitro.illinois.edu), a NSF Expedition in Computing program developing the science and technology to fabricate, model and program systems based on living neurons.

My research centers on machine learning and neural simulation techniques to learn to interact with in vitro neuron cultures ([Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=n8fv7j4AAAAJ), [GitHub](https://github.com/frthjf)).

Before joining Illinois, I studied Physics in [Göttingen](https://www.uni-goettingen.de) with a thesis in the [Computational Neuroscience Group](https://alexandria.physik3.uni-goettingen.de/cns-group/) and obtained a master's degree in Cognitive Science from the [University College London](http://ucl.ac.uk/), where I was advised by [Franz Király](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/statistics/people/franz-kiraly). I also spent time in industry at [Graphcore](https://www.graphcore.ai/).

Feel free to contact me via [email](mailto:mail@frthjf.com).
