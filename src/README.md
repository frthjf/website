Hi, I am **Frithjof Gressmann**. I am a Ph.D. student in the department of Computer Science at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC). 

Before joining Illinois, I studied Physics in [Göttingen](https://www.uni-goettingen.de) with a thesis in the [Computational Neuroscience Group](https://alexandria.physik3.uni-goettingen.de/cns-group/) and obtained a master's degree in Cognitive Science from the [University College London](http://ucl.ac.uk/), where I was advised by [Franz Király](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/statistics/people/franz-kiraly). I also spent time in industry at [Graphcore](https://www.graphcore.ai/).

Please feel free to [reach out](contact.md) to me with any questions, comments, ideas etc.
